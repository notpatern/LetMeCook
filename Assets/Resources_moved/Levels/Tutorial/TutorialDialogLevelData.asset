      Red obelisks will dispense you red food which will allow you to dash using
      [Dash Key]. Don\u2019t ask me why the food is magic, I have no idea bro- can
      I call you bro? or would you rather sis? mh.. I\u2019ll call you Chef, it\u2019s

      alright no big deal. If you want to carry more than two pieces of food at the
      same time you can use a Hell Crystal with [Merge Keys]  to store the ingredients
      you\u2019re currently carrying, oh and once you\u2019ve stored them you can\u2019t
      get them out! So be careful with the crystal!"
